> GPT-3 has “learned how to learn”: in its endless training on so many gigabytes of text,
> it encounters so many different kinds of text that it had no choice but to learn abstractions.

> This family of phenomena is perhaps driven by neural networks functioning as ensembles
> of many sub-networks.

> It is sufficiently powerful a model that its sub-models can do anything from poetry to arithmetic,
> and it is trained on so much data that those superficial models may do well early on,
> but gradually fall behind more abstract models.

Making models more interpretable

+ Many MLP neurons appear to be polysemantic, responding to multiple unrelated features
(unlike the [Grandmother cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_cell)).

+ One plausible explanation for polysemanticity is the superposition hypothesis, which suggests that neural network layers have more features than neurons as part of a “sparse coding” strategy to simulate a much larger layer.

## Other

+ The nodes are the variables and the weights are the program.

+ Causal interventions on the internals of a model.

+ Activation patching - run the model twice; replace a node's activation in one run with the activation from the other run.
+ It measures counter-factuals.  What would 

+ Path patching

+ Automatic circuit discovery

+ With patching in general, you have to choose your input distribution carefully.

+ Attention heads (?) can refer to other info by value or by pointer.  They showed that, in their IOI example, the second John was being referred to by (relative) pointer.
